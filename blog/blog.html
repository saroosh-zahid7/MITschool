<p id="blog1"><b>Sir.Jordan Belford | 12-September-2019</b></p>
<p id="blog2">If you imagine that you’ll need to teach someone else the material or task you are trying to grasp, 
you can speed up your learning and remember more, according to a study done at Washington University in St. Louis. 
The expectation changes your mind-set so that you engage in more effective approaches to learning than those who 
simply learn to pass a test, according to John Nestojko, a postdoctoral researcher in psychology and coauthor of 
the study.“When teachers prepare to teach, they tend to seek out key points and organize information into a coherent 
structure,” Nestojko writes. “Our results suggest that students also turn to these types of effective learning strategies 
when they expect to teach.” Brief, frequent learning sessions are much better than longer, infrequent ones, agrees Neil Starr, 
a course mentor at Western Governors University, an online nonprofit university where the average student earns a bachelor’s degree 
in two and a half years.</p><hr/>
